# PyOLXGUI
I found it pretty hard to keep track of blocks and close every tag using the current system on Olex2. So I decided to 
start building this. 

I aim to convert [h3-refine_NoSpherA2-occ-extras.htm](h3-refine_NoSpherA2-extras.htm) to Python in this format to 
test if it works. 

It is very early stage, so if anyone uses it expect bugs. If someone actually uses it and find bugs, please open an issue
every issue is welcome!

I do realize there is something similar in the SVN repository, but I wanted to do something a little different.
